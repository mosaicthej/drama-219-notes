# Notes Jan 21st. (Tue)

## Spatial awareness

- Balance the plate
- Notice where are people, keep track with 5 people, color of cloth, etc. 

## Character building

Imagine a historical character, and taking breaths to become that character.

Once that, do actions (wake up sequence), walk around, have a place to go.

(Create contexts on your own based on prompts, ex. going to a town, see a statue,
see a monster, etc.)

Getting out the character

Reflections on that.

## Reading and stage design

Design stage/setting.

Given a stage, how to layout, where furnitures, window, door, etc.
